            Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with few characteristic
            symptoms. Those symptoms include abnormalities in eye contact (eye
            gaze) and body language, lack of facial expressions, poorly
            integrated verbal and nonverbal communication, abnormal social
            approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation
            (reciprocity), deficits in understanding and use of gestures,
            stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, ritualized patterns of
            verbal and nonverbal behavior, excessive smelling or touching of
            objects. Availability of few or more symptoms and severity (vary by
            context and fluctuate over time) of those symptoms create “spectrum”
            of disorders, hence called Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The
            Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Autism and
            Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network (ADDM) report that
            approximately one in 68 children can be identified with the above
            symptoms in USA. Systematic reviews have published varying rates in
            prevalence due to lack of organized screening and survey. In Asia,
            the South Asia region represents more than 20% of the world’s
            population, yet the prevalence of ASD in this part of the world is
            still largely unknown. In a study done in Sri Lanka it was revealed
            that by the age of 24 months, only 14.3% of children with autism
            have sought treatment, which was a low figure compared to Western
            countries. In Sri Lanka at present, there are few facilities
            available, but, for majority of families, these remain inaccessible
            because of high cost. Autism interventions require multidisciplinary
            resources (speech therapists, occupational therapists, and
            psychologists). These resources are not available in many parts of
            the country. In one study it was reported that majority of General
            Medical Officers (GMOs) in Sri Lanka, who are often the first point
            of contact for families, are unaware of the characteristics of ASD.
            A study done in a tertiary children hospital revealed that 34% of
            the doctors were unaware of the main presenting symptoms as speech
            delay and a further 39% failed to recognize the co-morbidities in
            ASD.The screening methods for ASD have not been systematic in our
            country over the past years. Many tools have been used, but up to
            now there are no standards set for screening of this vulnerable
            group of children. Signs of ASD appears as early as 6 months of age
            and early diagnosis is vital as early intensive behavioral
            interventions improve adaptive behavior, language and intelligence
            in autism and diagnostic delays can worsen prognosis. On early
            diagnosis, symptoms involving eye gaze, reciprocity, motor skills,
            gait and speech play major roles.

            Methodology

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            <b>System Overview</b><br />
            This research is carried out to develop an automated culturally
            sensitive tool capable of screening young children for evidence of
            ASD. The proposed tool collects gaze, gait, emotion and speech
            information of children and analyses them for evidence of ASD. The
            system overview of the proposed system during the training phase is
            shown in the below figure.
          </p>

          <img
            style="margin: auto; display: block"
            src="assets/img/2.png"
            class="img-fluid"
            alt=""
          />

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            As shown in the figure, the system collects video and audio of
            children, in particular, related to gait, gaze, emotion and speech,
            which are processed by two modules in the data pre-processor,
            namely, audio extraction module and video segmentation module. The
            purpose of the above two modules is to refine and prepare collected
            data to be processed by the modules in the data analyzer. The data
            analyzer module consists of three modules namely gaze and emotion
            analysis module, gait and movement analysis module and speech
            analysis module which analyzes gaze and emotion, gait and movement
            and speech respectively for signs of ASD. The decisions made by
            those three modules independently are, next, sent to the decision
            maker module which makes a prediction based on the inputs. Once the
            decision marker module makes a prediction, the prediction made is
            compared with the decision made by a MHS who analyses the same
            inputs. If the prediction made by the system is different from the
            decision made by the Medical Health Specialists (MHS), the feedback
            is fed to the decision maker module and the data analyzer module
            would be further refined. Once the prediction made by the system is
            equal to the MHS decision, the decision maker module is considered
            ready for implementation. <br /><br />
            Use of socially assistive robots in screening, diagnosis, and
            therapeutic settings of ASD affected children have been reported in
            various literature. It is interesting to note that autistic children
            do like to interact with small humanoid robot compared to human.
            Therefore, in this research, it is intended to use a humanoid robot
            in a simulation environment to engage with children screened
            positive by initial assessments. A humanoid robot with required
            audio and video sensors to capture both verbal and non-verbal cues
            of communication, facial expressions, gestures and postures, and
            gait and movement of children with required sensitivity will be
            utilized in this research. This robot will be equipped with
            aforesaid algorithms to generate a screening report with an
            assessment score that indicates how apparent the deficiency of
            behavior is affected by ASD. A report of this nature will be used as
            a precursor for diagnosis as well as effectiveness of treatment
            plans. Some children who are normal until 12 months to 18 months of
            age “Regress” to ASD as a type of ASD. The CSSAR can be employed to
            assess the “Progress” or the “Regress” of children identified by
            tier-1 or getting treatments as shown in the below figure.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            There is a variation of appearing the array of autistic symptoms in
            children with ASD. Sometimesthese symptoms are highly apparent or
            are subtle and difficult to identify. Fuzziness of the level of
            significance of apparent ASD symptoms will be captured with the aid
            of an expert panel which consists of a child psychiatrist, a
            pediatric neurologist, and a speech therapist to train the SAR to
            improve its accuracy. In this simulation environment, we can capture
            data from children who are susceptible as ASD affected children.
            Necessary modifications will be implemented to this robot to capture
            the audio and video signals of these children for future research to
            improve the quality of assessments.
