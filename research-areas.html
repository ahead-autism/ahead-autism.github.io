						<p style="text-align:justify">Children with ASD often have challenges in speech and language usage. In CSAAT project, it is aimed at programming/training a robot to maintain a dialogue with children with the intention of recognizing ASD landmarks in the conversation.

Lack of speech is the main symptom that 82.4% of children were directed to clinics at the average age of 35.8 months and finally get diagnosed for ASD. Children can be directed for early intervention by identifying the symptoms appears in speech and language such as difficulties in prosody, abstract use of language, echolalia, delay in response and limited amount of functional words that appears as early as first 6 -18 months of life. Kaldi based novel Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system in Sinhala for children is to be developed that can recognize speech impairments in autistic children in early childhood utterances and help the speech therapists to carryout therapeutic activities to overcome ASD.

						  <p style="text-align:justify">According to recent statistics, one among 95 kids in Sri Lanka is diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),
a neuro-developmental disorder. In Sri Lanka, they are identified at average of 35.6 months of age where
symptoms can be diagnosed as early as 6 months. Early diagnosis and clinical intervention improve them to coexist with typical students when they enter schools. ASD consists of pool of social interaction impairments
including speech and language impairments such as echolalia, poor reciprocity in conversations, self-talk, delay
in response, respond in a few words or no talk at all. A Novel Sinhala Dialogue Management System based on
RASA framework is proposed to engage with atypical kids to instigate above hallmarks in language impairments
to assess the level of impairment and conduct therapeutic conversations to help recovery. Culturally inherited
role-plays and conversational games will be used to sustain interest and engagement of the kids.</p><br>

						<div class="content text2speech-research-section" ><br>  
						  <p style="text-align:justify">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment disorder which presents a spectrum of symptoms affecting the social interactions of an individual. The challenges faced in non-verbal communication and the delays and regression in speech associated with the language development of children present the need for an early screening and diagnosis for autistic children, allowing them to lead a normal life, with minimal hindrance as a result of their symptoms. The lack of diagnostic and screening processes for Autism in Sri Lanka hinders individuals from receiving the necessary health care to lead a normal life. This study aims to develop a system to translate Sinhalese child directed text to an audio output, with the incorporation of prosodic features to grasp childrensâ€™ attention. The proposed Text-To-Speech system is the first ever attempt in the development of a speech screening tool for children as early as 6 months of age. The analysis in Sinhala language further highlights the novelty of this research. The proposed system could be used as a communication interface in the attempt of maintaining a smooth back-and-forth conversation between child and robot, to assist in the screening of autistic traits in children.</p><br>

						<p style="text-align:justify">A variety of movement disturbances including atypical gait, upper limb movements and postural control are also important as early signs of autism. Atypical gait is defined as an unusual style of walking from the normal pattern of walking and researchers have tried many different variables to test the abnormal gait patterns of children with ASD. Most studies have either used basic gait measurements, kinematic, kinetic or a combination of these. A limited research has been conducted on the link between infant motor skills and autism and much of the literature tend to provide a qualitative description of gait and motion based on the observation of clinicians. Thus, it is imperative to quantify these descriptions with measuring tools real time, specially starting as early as 6 months of age. Therefore, automated tools for quantitative gait and motion analysis have become vital for assessing pathologies manifested by atypical motor behaviors. This research is to analyze the gesture and gait patterns of children with Autism. </p>

						<p style="text-align:justify">About 1 in every 160 children globally has autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is a developmental disability, which is characterized by social, emotional, and communication challenges. Recent advancements in the research domain of socially-assistive robots have shown a promising direction to use robots to help children with ASD. A socially-assistive robot can be built with capabilities such as games to engage children, collect data and to identify the risk of developing ASD; thus, enabling early interventions to improve their conditions. Further, recent research has shown that socially-assistive robots can be successfully used for enhancing social skills of children with ASD as well. In this particular MPhil project an already available programmable robot will be developed as a social-assistive robot to perform the above mentioned functions. The primary focus will be on early detection of ASD related behavior, although the same robot may be extended as a therapeutic agent as well.</p>

						<p style="text-align:justify">The presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviors (RRBs), interests, and activities is one of the key indicators of Autism. Individuals may engage in stereotyped and repetitive motor movements (e.g., hand flapping, rocking, punching, drumming or lining up items) or speech. They may have an insistence on sameness. RRBs can be problematic when others interfere with the childâ€™s way of behavior leading to anxiety and aggression. This research focuses on identifying the RRBs of the children and finding ways to automate the behavior analysis and prediction.</p>

						<p style="text-align:justify">Children with ASD have shown variant behaviors in eye contact, disengagement of visual attention, visual tracking and social interest and affect in comparison to typically developing (TD) children. These social cues that we measure, gaze and attention in particular, can be recorded in greater detail and at an early age which would give more opportunities for diagnosis of ASD and early intervention. Though there has been few research studies in developed countries using gaze patterns for autistic screening, the devices and technologies they have used are not affordable in Sri Lanka. This research area attempts to find affordable techniques for evaluating gaze and attention of children with Autism. </p>

						<p style="text-align:justify">The CSAAT project aims to early-detect Autism in young children using anomalies in emotion, gaze, movement, and speech by application of machine learning / deep learning techniques. This requires collection and storage of large volumes of video, speech and image data, along with corresponding meta-data. Meta-data could be automatically extracted features from the data, or annotations made by researchers. Further, it is required to perform custom queries to retrieve certain subsets of this data on-demand, using the above meta-data as search parameters. This section addresses the research questions such as what meta-data could (and should) be extracted from the source data, how best to design the interface to make annotations, and how the meta-data could be stored and indexed.</p>

						<p style="text-align:justify">The main analysis on the CSAAT project involves videos of children for early detection of the
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Often, monitoring and quantifying the ability of children to interact with parents and professional therapists is essential in identifying any potential issues in their development growth. In this research, we plan to analyse the interactions between child and mother/examiner. This involves the use of image pre-processing techniques along with deep learning techniques such as graph neural networks to analyse the behaviours of the child as well as his/her interaction with others. The outcomes of this research may be useful in early identification and continuous monitoring of development goals and social interaction expectations of children.</p>
